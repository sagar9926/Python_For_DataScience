Assumption of Linear Regression model --

> The linear regression model assumes that there is a straight-line relationship between the predictors & the response. Residual plots are useful graphical tool to identify the non-linearity.If the residual plot indicates that there are non-linear associations in the data, then a simple approach is to use non-linear transformations of the predictors, such as logX, √X, and X2, in the regression model.

> An important assumption of the linear regression model is that the error terms, ε1, ε2, . . . , εn, are uncorrelated. What does this mean? For instance, if the errors are uncorrelated, then the fact that εi is positive provides little or no information about the sign of εi+1.  In short, if the error terms are correlated, we may have an unwarranted sense of confidence in our model, such a problem occurs mostly in the time series data. 

> Another important assumption of the linear regression model is that the error terms have a constant variance, Var(εi) = σ2 . When faced with this problem, one possible solution is to transform the response Y using a concave function such as log Y.

> No Outliers

> No High Leverage points 

> No Collinearity
